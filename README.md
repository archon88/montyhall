# montyhall

A simple Fortran program to demonstrate the correct solution to the Monty Hall problem. After compilation, a number of run cycles must be specified, after which the program prints the result of either strategy (keep/change) to the files **keep.dat** and **change.dat** and to standard output. For a suitably large number of cycles, the expected result (change succeeds 2/3 of the time) is obtained.
